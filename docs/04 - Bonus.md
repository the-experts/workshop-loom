# Bonus Assignment: Unlocking Virtual Threads in Spring Boot

Ventured through the previous challenges? Now awaits a deeper dive with Spring Boot's affinity for virtual threads. Your new quest is to refactor the application employing Spring Boot's asynchronous features. Each framework has its unique approach towards asynchronous processing; mastering this within Spring Boot not only enriches your understanding but prepares you for similar endeavors in other frameworks. This bonus task is set to broaden your horizon, as you explore, adapt, and triumph over the asynchronous realm of Spring Boot.

## Your Challenge

Your expedition involves three main stages. At each stage, hints are provided to nudge you in the right direction. The ultimate test of your prowess lies in your ability to seek, find, and implement solutions, with the vast resources of the internet at your disposal should you find yourself in dire straits.

### 1. **Enabling Asynchronous Execution:**
- Your first clue lies in a magical annotation that unlocks Spring Boot's asynchronous execution capabilities. Seek it out!
- Now, venture into the realm of configuration, where an interface awaits your implementation. This interface is the key to customizing asynchronous execution. Find it, and implement it!

### 2. **Executor Configuration:**
- In the heart of the configuration, a method cries out for your attention. Overriding this method will allow you to return a custom `Executor` suited for virtual threads. Which executor could this be? The new Spring Boot version has brought with it a knightly executor tailored for virtual threads. Seek it out!
- A certain property in the `application.properties` holds the key to enabling virtual threads. Unearth this property, and set it to the path of enlightenment.

### 3. **Refactoring Methods:**
- Identify the methods within your service classes that should transcend into the asynchronous realm.
- Your quest in this stage involves refactoring these methods. A future is foretold, a `CompletableFuture` to be precise. An annotation also awaits your discovery, which will mark these methods for asynchronous execution.

### 4. **Testing Your Mettle:**
- With your refactored code, run your application, execute the tests, and observe the performance metrics. How have the virtual threads impacted the performance?
- Your observation skills are put to the test here. Use JConsole to monitor the behavior of virtual threads as your application processes the data.

This task is engineered to push your boundaries. Dive into the documentation, seek answers on the web, and emerge with a bounty of knowledge. The road may be fraught with challenges, but the rewards are great. May the codes be ever in your favor! Happy coding!
